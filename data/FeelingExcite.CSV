with excitement ,兴奋地,D
feel a surge of excitement ,感到一阵激动,D
flush with excitement ,激动得满脸通红,*D
a mixture of excitement and happiness,既兴奋又开心,*D
feelings run high ,情绪很激动,*D
twinkle with excitement ,激动得两眼发亮,*D
couldn't contain one's excitement ,无法抑制自己的兴奋,*D
a sparkle of excitement in one's eyes ,眼里闪耀着激动的光芒,*D
"one's heart beats wildly, one's heart pounds wildly ",某人的心脏怦怦直跳,*D
